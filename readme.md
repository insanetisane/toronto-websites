# Static sites for small businesses
## Overview
### Background
*How did the business get its start? What challenges is it facing?*

Need to streamline process and keep sites simple to avoid headaches. To be unique among other web developers. Wordpress sites are to bulky and time consuming to develop. Users don't get much out of Wordpress in general, it's another barrier to getting content online.

*WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO STYLE OR RESTYLE YOUR BRAND?*
*It’s important for you to identify upfront why you’re doing this. Do you want to be taken more seriously in the market? Are you launching a new business, product or service and therefore want to make the right impact from the get-go? Perhaps you’ve had a fabulous year and have decided to celebrate with a look that really does you justice? Maybe you are changing direction and need your brand identity to reflect that? Whatever your motivations, be clear from the outset.*

### Project Objective and Business Goals
The goals of the business and of this project. Desired action for user to take.

**Objective:** To get filtered small business owners to contact me via the online form.

**Goals:** To get a good client base that has reoccurring subscriptions for SEO and content management. Eventually a good chunk of my income would be from this and the rest from new website clients. 

*WHAT’S YOUR AIM FOR THIS PROJECT?*
*How will you know the rebrand has been a success? What do you need it to do for you? Are there misconceptions about your business right now? Do people think you’re cheaper than you are perhaps? Are you attracting the wrong sorts of clients?*
*Perhaps you’re losing business because you’ve changed direction, so your communications need updating to reflect that. Maybe you’re missing opportunities or you’re simply not being taken seriously. Where possible, create a SMART goal (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timed) that you can measure your success against.*

*WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO YOU SPECIALISE IN?*
*If you could be known for just one thing in your business, what would it be? If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about your business, what would that be?*
*Are you selling what inspires you? Are you known for products and services that have you leaping out of bed in the morning? And do they sell? Are there product lines or services you’d like to drop and others that you’d love to major in? This is your chance to gain focus or to reinvent yourself and your business!*

*WHAT MAKES YOU STAND HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE COMPETITION*
*What do you really excel at? What else? And what else?*

### Target Audience
*WHO ARE YOUR PROFITABLE CLIENTS? WHY DO THEY BUY FROM YOU?*
*what motivates them to work with you? What do they value about what you do?*

*IS THERE A TYPE OF CLIENT YOU’RE NOT CURRENTLY ATTRACTING?*
*is there another group of customers who would really benefit from your business that you’re not currently attracting?*
*Who would you really love as a client? Which blogs or magazines would you love to be associated with or featured in?*
*Could you put together a list of dream clients? Ask yourself: ‘What would these prospective clients need to see on my website to be compelled to do business with me?’*

Who is the ideal client / audience?
Male or female?
Age group?
Who is the ideal person?

### Message
*WHAT DO YOU FIND MOST INSPIRATIONAL ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS?*
*anything that needs to change about the way you present your business so that you can do more of the things that you love and less of those that you don’t?*
*What, precisely, is it about that client that you admire? What is it about the project that motivates you? How can you tap into that energy to grow your business?*

*WHAT VALUES DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS?*
*‘What’s important to you about the way you run your business?’ ‘What matters in terms of how you treat your clients, staff and suppliers?’*

*What is the main message of this project?*

Want business owner to feel security in that I will not abandon him after the site is done. That the website is truly an investment. It will be able to be found by the right people.

### Competition
*What other companies offer something similar?*

 - company two

### Distinguishing Characteristics
*WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR?*
*If you were to plot out what makes you different from your competitors, how would that look? What proposition are your competitors trading on and how is that different from what you want to be known for?*
*What is it about your product or service that your clients really value?*
*What makes you unique? And how can you communicate that?*
*Find a spot in the market that only you can own and use this focus to align all of your communications with this one, compelling proposition.*

*WHO, EXACTLY, SHOULD THIS NEW BRAND IDENTITY BLOW AWAY?*
*who you really want to impress with your newly styled brand. Think beyond clients. Perhaps it’s more about getting a big supplier or a retail outlet to take a closer look at your business? Maybe you wish to attract and retain quality staff?*
*Prioritize.*

*HOW SHOULD YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS FEEL WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR NEWLY STYLED BRAND?*
*What should they think about your business?*

*What would your new brand identity need to do in order to reflect your exciting vision?*

*What would you be doing with your business if nothing were standing in your way? If you knew you couldn’t fail? Who would you be working with, what would you be doing (or selling?) and how would you be doing it?*
